    	<description>The terrifying entity known as the "Hungry Angel of Yaldabaoth" showed intelligence beyond that of ordinary entities... Perhaps other entities also have similar intelligence but have not yet used it, but its proficiency in using human weapons has brought new enlightenment. The stinking dream is getting closer and closer. Attempts to replicate their ability to use weapons have been successful, but there are still great limitations in their mobility. We can create this kind of flesh golem and let it take our best weapons to defend our homeland instead of us.</description>

    	<label>Dream Approaching</label>
    	<description>Ever since we touched the monolith and embarked on the path of studying anomaly biotechnology, that fishy, sticky dream has appeared from time to time. It often gave us terrible inspiration, as if some existence that unknown if it has malicious intent led us to this path of no return...\n But now, some things have become clear. That dream is real, and Yaldabaoth also exists - but Yaldabaoth has long fallen into a deep sleep, and the existence called the Raw Prophet spreads his gospel on his behalf.\n There has never been just one Void, never just one Mansu, and never just one Adytum...The universe has another side that we all know but ignore. Although the other side cannot help this side break the limit of light speed, all psychic technology exists based on that side.\n The existence called the God of the Void used its monolith to mark the anchor point, and provided a passage for it or other hyperintelligent archotech mind and their servants who live or sleep at the intersection of the two sides. And now, we will try to tear open the thirsty door and seize the wisdom of the Prophet.\n\n We want to become the new Ozirmok.</description>

    	<description>And Ion held six fingers aloft and upon their spears did the soldiers impale themselves. "For you!" they cried before the blood drowned their tongues. And Ion said, "Now do you see?" And Nadox wept, as more did skewer themselves in Ion's name, for he had seen and now knew the truth of his words.</description>

    	<description>Beneath the Black Moon, Her Devotion took the form of a stone knife, like those of the reindeer folk of Adí-üm. Penetrated, amber blood, colored by ancient sins, poured from the wound - her tears like the warm rain of distant summers.\nBeneath the Poison Moon, the amber flowed no more - and the snow, she painted red. [indecipherable] for Ion, who drank deep the mead of ecstasy.\nAnd from Lovataar's dark lips flowed words: "There is pleasure in serving." Smiling, Ion fell to their knees - knowing the drunk joy of milk and sweet fermented honey.</description>
